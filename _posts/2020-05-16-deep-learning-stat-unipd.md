The following material was used during the Data Mining course of the faculty of Statistics at University of Padua.

## Presentations

Below there are the slides used for presenting the lecture during the following conferences:

## Notebooks

Below there are 2 case studies for a beginning approach to the deep learning. The notebooks are implemented in `R` programming language, using the `keras` package:
* **MNIST case study**: *image recognition* use case, solved using a *convolutional neural network* [[ita](/assets/notebooks/MNIST_caso_studio.html)]
* **IMDB case study**: *sentiment analysis* use case, solved using a *recurrent neural network* [[ita](/assets/notebooks/IMDB_caso_studio.html)]
