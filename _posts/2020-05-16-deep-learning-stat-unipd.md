The following material was used during the Data Mining course of the faculty of Statistics at University of Padua.

## Presentations

Below there are the slides used for presenting the lecture during the following conferences:
* [19<sup>th</sup> May 2017](/assets/presentations/deep_learning_2017.pdf)
* [11<sup>th</sup> May 2018](/assets/presentations/deep_learning_2018.pdf)
* [24<sup>th</sup> May 2019](/assets/presentations/deep_learning_2019.pdf)
* [22<sup>nd</sup> May 2020](/assets/presentations/deep_learning_2020.pdf)

## Notebooks

Below there are 2 case studies for a beginning approach to the deep learning. The notebooks are implemented in `R` programming language, using the `keras` package:
* **MNIST case study**: *image recognition* use case, solved using a *convolutional neural network* [[eng](/assets/notebooks/MNIST_case_study.html)\|[ita](/assets/notebooks/MNIST_caso_studio.html)]
* **IMDB case study**: *sentiment analysis* use case, solved using a *recurrent neural network* [[eng](/assets/notebooks/IMDB_case_study.html)\|[ita](/assets/notebooks/IMDB_caso_studio.html)]
